Additional context
Interoperability Protocols Play A Vital Role In Enabling Communication & Interaction Between Different Systems, Software Applications & Technologies.

At The Moment Scroll Is Deployed On Orbiter, Owlto, Rhino, Layerswap & Layerzero But Its Not Deployed On Other Interoperability Protocols That Connects It To Other Evm, Non Evm & L1 Blockchains Like Solana Near Fuse Aptos Sei Oasis & A Lot More

Deploying Scroll On Aptos, Celestia, Would Connect A Long List Of L1 & Non Evm Blockchains To Scroll, There By Enabling Easy Acccessibilty & A Very Fast Onboarding.
